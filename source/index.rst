Spatial Data Science with R and "terra"
=======================================

These resources teach spatial data analysis and modeling with *R*. *R* is a widely used programming language and software environment for data science. *R* also provides unparalleled opportunities for analyzing spatial data and for spatial modeling. 

**This is the "terra" version of this resource. You can also use the more elaborate** `"raster" <https://rspatial.org/raster/index.html>`_ **version.** 


If you have never used *R*, or if you need a refresher, you should start with our `Introduction to R <../intr/index.html>`__
